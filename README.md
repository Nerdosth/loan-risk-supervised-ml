#### Predict Model Performance

You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct!

Write down your prediction in the designated cells in your Jupyter Notebook, and provide justification for your educated guess.

#### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create the features DataFrame, `X`, by removing the `loan_status` column. Create `y`, the labels set, by using the `loan_status` column. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using the `train_test_split` function.

#### Create, Fit and Compare Models

Create a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the training data that you created in the previous step. Then, determine the model's score by using the `score` function and the testing data from the previous step. Do the same for a Random Forest Classifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like.

Review the scores of each model. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts in the designated markdown cell.
